With 2 different COVID-19 datasets to hand, Iâ€™ve expanded my skills in Python, making use of libraries including:
  Pandas
  Plotly
  FigureWidgets
  Sklearn

The 2 datasets:
  New reported cases & deaths by day, by country.
  Each policy measure taken by day, by country.

The resulting outputs include:
  Evolution of the virus by day, with a country dropdown.
  Infection rate plotted against the mortality rate.
  The number of advance policies (before the country's first recorded case) against the infection rate.
  Simple Linear Regression model, which finds that implementation of advance policies is scarcely responsible for the infection rate.
